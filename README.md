# IslandSurveyTool
A set of python functions for use doing automated surveys of https://islands.smp.uq.edu.au

Note: this code is a mess and was developed on the fly without much attention to organization. It is designed to be run and then interacted with in the interpreter.

I might document it sometime, but it's not a priority now that the semester's over. In lieu of documentation, contact me if you have questions.
